excerpt: Wildlife (and conservation) have been extremely preoccupied with individual values, attitudes, and beliefs as precursors for behavioral change. Here we try to build an alternative explanatation for why wildlife conservation is (increasingly) hard

## What is political polarization?
Define polarization. Is it different than partisanship? Is there a reason to distinguish between the two?

## What do we know about polarization and the environment?

## Why might polarization matter for wildlife conservation?
Wildlife management in North America is carried out under the public trust doctrine wherein all of the citizens of a nation "own" the wildlife, but they are held in trust by the state. Although this frees us from aristocratic notions of wildlife being tied to property, it does mean that we have to understand what our trustees want in order to act on behalf of their trust. This is tricky. Different "publics" have different goals for wildlife (and maybe for different species of wildlife). Some folks might want more (or better) hunting opportunities for things with antlers or feathers. Some folks might want to symbols of "American wilderness" to continue to exist. Some folks might want to see more of a rare species, others might want to see less of a species that causes physical or financial harm. Navigating these different objectives while constrained by the "laws" of population dynamics and species ecology has historically been treated as a technical problem and the task for state (and some federal) biologists. 

Values, DEFINE, and their descendents, the logic goes, matter because they shape both the objectives a "public" may have AND provide the guideposts for evaluating the success of these technical interventions in order to hold the state accountable. Lurking behind the scenes, however, are a number of places where politics intervenes potentially confusing the link between individual values and the collective choices we make about how we want wildlife to be managed. Perhaps the most obvious place this shows up is in the makeup of state wildlife agency leadership commissions. These entities craft the direction of the state by setting priorities, approving budgets, and attempting to influence the various components of the technocracy. In the United States, xxx of these are comprised of individuals appointed by the governor, xxx of these are elected independently, and xxx of these are made up of long-time agency employees. In Canada, where provinces retain this function xxx, yyy, zzz.  As such, the winner of elections helps arbiter which "publics" trust responsibilities are met and which are not (or at least de-emphasized). 

In addition to the potential effects of politics (and thus, polarization) on the structural core of wildlife management agencies, an increasing number of natural resource decisions are being made via direct (e.g.,, ballot initiatives) or representative (e.g., state or federal legislation) democracy. For example, gray wolves were recently reintroduced to Colorado following a ballot initiative passed by Colorado residents. Interestingly, Congress passed laws removing wolves from Endangered Species Act protections in the northern Rockies (2011) and across the rest of the US (2024). In both cases, the votes largely followed party lines. As importantly, donors contributing to each side of the campaigns were some of the usual suspects engaged in partisan issues. 

Although the passage of the wolf reintroduction ballot measure is consistent with the notion that American wildlife values are becoming more mutualistic, the removal of wolves from the protection of the Endangered Species Act is not. Similarly, most (all?) states continue to rely primarily on hunting and fishing revenues, an approach consistent with utilitarian values, as the means of supporting non-game species conservation actions suggests that individual values (and changes to those values) alone do not explain contemporary wildlife decision-making. There are two alternatives that might be worth exploring. The first is the one we've been talking about here: namely that in situations where technical expertise is lacking, people tend to revert towards their political identities (which may be distinct from their personal values towards wildlife). The second is that species matters resulting in different preferences depending which species is under consideration.

## What are some good empirical signals of polarization?

## How do we use models to identify polarization?

```{r}
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000
age <- runif(n = n, min = 0, max = 7)

# Simulate latent trait (centered)
eta <- scale(0.3 * age + rnorm(n, 0, 1))  # mean ~0, sd ~1

# Loadings
lambda <- c(1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 1.2)

# Generate latent responses
V_latent <- sapply(lambda, function(l) l * eta + rnorm(n, 0, 1))

# Use quantile-based thresholds for 5 equal-sized categories
make_ordinal <- function(x) {
  q <- quantile(x, probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = 6))  # 5 categories = 6 cutpoints
  cut(x, breaks = q, include.lowest = TRUE, labels = FALSE, ordered_result = TRUE)
}

ordinal <- apply(V_latent, 2, make_ordinal)

# Final dataset
ordinal_df <- as.data.frame(ordinal)
names(ordinal_df) <- paste0("V", 1:4)
ordinal_df$age <- age
ordinal_df$ID <- 1:n

# Check balance
sapply(ordinal_df[1:4], table)

library(brms)

# Ordinal outcome models (all responses depend on person-level latent trait eta)
bf1 <- bf(V1 ~ age + (1 | eta | ID), family = cumulative("logit"))
bf2 <- bf(V2 ~ age + (1 | eta | ID), family = cumulative("logit"))
bf3 <- bf(V3 ~ age + (1 | eta | ID), family = cumulative("logit"))
bf4 <- bf(V4 ~ age + (1 | eta | ID), family = cumulative("logit"))


# Latent trait model: eta depends on age
bf_eta <- bf(eta ~ 1 + age + (1 | ID))  # latent trait varies by age and individual

# Fit the full latent trait model
fit_latent <- brm(
  bf1 + bf2 + bf3 + set_rescor(FALSE),
  data = ordinal_df,
  chains = 4, cores = 4, iter = 2000,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95), 
  backend = "cmdstanr"
)

```
