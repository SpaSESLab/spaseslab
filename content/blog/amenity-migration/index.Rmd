title: "What Does the Amenity Transition Look Like?"
author: "Matt Williamson"
date: '2025-07-30'
excerpt: The idea of amenity migration and its contribution to the conversion of the Old West to the New West is an idea that is frequently invoked in lots of conservation, policy, governance, and geography literature. Yet, it's the sort of thing that we identify in a sort of _post hoc_ way. In this post, I'm hoping to use a few time series of data to see if we can identify common trajectories in the transition from an extraction-based economy to one based on amenities. Perhaps, if we can see common paths, we might find a better way to anticipate and mitigate the sorts of social strife that tend to accompany this much-touted shift.

The transition from natural resource based economies to those based on the provision of (typically natural) amenities has been touted as a means of reducing conflict surrounding endangered species, protecting wilderness, and myriad other changes to rural land use (check out [Headwaters Economics](https://headwaterseconomics.org/public-lands/) if you're looking for examples). This transition is suggested to diversify job opportunities and create new career paths for residents while also avoiding the boom and bust cycles that tend to typify communities whose economies are based on the production of natural resource-based commodities. At the same time, this transition has been characterized by population displacement (i.e. "rural gentrification"), social conflict, and psychological harm as residents navigate the remaking of their "place". I have casually followed some of this literature for some time now. After all, part of my thinking about conservation is rooted in the idea that if people had alternatives, they might not choose to harm the environment. At the same time, I recognize that many of our environmental conflicts are just proxies for deeper social issues and believe that environmentalists would do well to attend to these issues if they're hoping for durable solutions to today's pantetary problems. I've never completely embraced the idea, however, because it feels like a bit of a "just-so" story. We can look at towns like Bozeman, MT, Driggs, ID, Springdale, UT, or Telluride, CO and agree that these places fit our ideas of "amenity towns". We can look at their population and make assumptions about whose from there, who moved "before everyone knew about it", and who might be the quintessential "amenity migrant". And while that's a fun source of conversation in a new local microbrewery or craft kombucha joint, it doesn't do much for those of us trying to understand the contributing factors that got us to this point or trying to identify interventions that might allow a small town to continue to exist without sacrificing the things its current residents love.

This blog post is an attempt to do two things:
1.  Teach myself a bit more about Community Trajectory Analysis and how to implement it in `R`
2.  Convince myself that there are certain paths that characterize the rural gentrification version of amenity towns from others that share similar locations, but haven't undergone that transition (yet).
