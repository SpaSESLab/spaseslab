<p>One of the hardest (both technically and emotionally) part of academic life is knowing when something is “good enough” and how long it will actually take you to get there. For undergrads, this challenge gets (slightly) reduced because coursework tends to have rubrics (to let you know what “good enough” looks like) and deadlines (the point at which, whether you like it or not, the thing is <em>done</em>). After undergrad, things get a little trickier. If you’re working outside of academia, there are likely to be deadlines, but little information on what is “good enough” (until your annual performance review comes through). If you’re continuing on into graduate school and academia, you may still have deadlines imposed by your program (though you’ll likely find that these are “recommendations” and are not always well aligned with your project), but there is very little information on what constitutes “good enough”.</p>
<p>Part of this is by design, your job is to advance knowledge. To learn something we didn’t know before possibly by trying something we’ve never done before. That makes it hard to create any sort of specific rubric. It also, sort of and in a psychologically manipulative way, keeps you from doing work that is aimed at satisfying an arbitrary “bar” rather than pushing yourself to do all that you can. Leaving that last bit aside for a later day wherein I question all of the systems I’ve been a part of, I though it might be helpful to spell out how I think about the process and give some attempt at justification for why I think about it this way<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<div id="complete" class="section level2">
<h2>Complete</h2>
<p>Whether you’re working on a paper for class, a manuscript for submission, or your entire thesis; the (first) goal is to have something that is “complete”. In my mind, this is a document that has all of the pieces of the argument (even if some are a little shaky or disjointed) that the paper is trying to make. It has an introduction that tells me why this matters, methods (if it’s an empirical paper) that describe what you did and why you did it, results with figures, tables, and captions (even if they’re preliminary), and a discussion that puts your work back in conversation with the broader literature.</p>
<p>A “complete” draft allows me (or other advisory reviewer) to be able to see the entire picture of where you’re trying to go so that they can give the sorts of substantive, high-level feedback that can help you figure out which places in your argument need clarification, which pieces might be extraneous, and whether there are other literatures you should be considering in your introduction or discussion. To get that sort of feedback, you need to make sure that grammatical mistakes are almost entirely cleaned up <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A “complete” draft does not have to be perfect (and you shouldn’t expect anyone to think that it is… yet)! There might be parts of your argument that need refinement or maybe you’re missing the perfect citation for a few key points. Your figures might not be pretty (or you might be trying a few more analyses). Your discussion might be more of a retelling and justification of what you did than a real conversation with the broader literature. That’s ok!! It’s also not a rough first draft. It should be a professional representation of your work and the thought you’ve put into it. It should make it clear to the reader that you’ve thought both about your work and about the fact that you are asking someone else to give their time to give you feedback. Beyond that, it’s a demonstration that you can take a project from beginning to end (ideally by an agreed-upon deadline)</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I haven’t been an academic my whole life (at least not occupationally). This advice comes from some sense of what it takes to get jobs at agencies, NGOs, or academia. Admittedly, this experience is largely in the conservation field and is limited to my own experience and those of colleagues I’ve been lucky enough to work with over the years. Your mileage may vary, but if you’re wondering what I expect, this is the best version I’ve got so far<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>fun fact: lots of typos, complex sentence structures, and incomplete thoughts give us an easy out to focus on those small things rather than making sure the ideas are solid. While this sort of feedback is often easier to remedy than the conceptual comments you are aiming for, it is also not a great use of anyone’s time and makes it more likely that you’ll have to go through more drafts to get to actually useful feedback.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
