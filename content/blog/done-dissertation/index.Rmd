One of the hardest (both technically and emotionally) part of academic life is knowing when something is "good enough" and how long it will actually take you to get there. For undergrads, this challenge gets (slightly) reduced because coursework tends to have rubrics (to let you know what "good enough" looks like) and deadlines (the point at which, whether you like it or not, the thing is *done*). After undergrad, things get a little trickier. If you're working outside of academia, there are likely to be deadlines, but little information on what is "good enough" (until your annual performance review comes through). If you're continuing on into graduate school and academia, you may still have deadlines imposed by your program (though you'll likely find that these are "recommendations" and are not always well aligned with your project), but there is very little information on what constitutes "good enough". 

Part of this is by design, your job is now to advance knowledge. To learn something we didn't know before possibly by trying something we've never done before. That makes it hard to create any sort of specific rubric. It also, sort of and in a psychologically manipulative way, keeps you from doing work that is aimed at satisfying an arbitrary "bar" rather than pushing yourself to do all that you can. Leaving that last bit aside for a later day wherein I question all of the systems I've been a part of, I though it might be helpful to spell out how I think about the process and give some attempt at justification for why I think about it this way.
