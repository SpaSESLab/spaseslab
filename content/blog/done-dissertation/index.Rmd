One of the hardest (both technically and emotionally) part of academic life is knowing when something is "good enough" and how long it will actually take you to get there. For undergrads, this challenge gets (slightly) reduced because coursework tends to have rubrics (to let you know what "good enough" looks like) and deadlines (the point at which, whether you like it or not, the thing is *done*). After undergrad, things get a little trickier. If you're working outside of academia, there are likely to be deadlines, but little information on what is "good enough" (until your annual performance review comes through). If you're continuing on into graduate school and academia, you may still have deadlines imposed by your program (though you'll likely find that these are "recommendations" and are not always well aligned with your project), but there is very little information on what constitutes "good enough". 

Part of this is by design, your job is to advance knowledge. To learn something we didn't know before possibly by trying something we've never done before. That makes it hard to create any sort of specific rubric. It also, sort of and in a psychologically manipulative way, keeps you from doing work that is aimed at satisfying an arbitrary "bar" rather than pushing yourself to do all that you can. Leaving that last bit aside for a later day wherein I question all of the systems I've been a part of, I though it might be helpful to spell out how I think about the process and give some attempt at justification for why I think about it this way^[I haven't been an academic my whole life (at least not occupationally). This advice comes from some sense of what it takes to get jobs at agencies, NGOs, or academia. Admittedly, this experience is largely in the conservation field and is limited to my own experience and those of colleagues I've been lucky enough to work with over the years. Your mileage may vary, but if you're wondering what I expect, this is the best version I've got so far]. 

## Complete
Whether you're working on a paper for class, a manuscript for submission, or your entire thesis; the (first) goal is to have something that is "complete". In my mind, this is a document that has all of the pieces of the argument (even if some are a little shaky or disjointed) that the paper is trying to make. It has an introduction that tells me why this matters, methods (if it's an empirical paper) that describe what you did and why you did it, results with figures, tables, and captions (even if they're preliminary), and a discussion that puts your work back in conversation with the broader literature. 

A "complete" draft allows me (or other advisory reviewer) to be able to see the entire picture of where you're trying to go so that they can give the sorts of substantive, high-level feedback that can help you figure out which places in your argument need clarification, which pieces might be extraneous, and whether there are other literatures you should be considering in your introduction or discussion. To get that sort of feedback, you need to make sure that grammatical mistakes are almost entirely cleaned up ^[fun fact: lots of typos, complex sentence structures, and incomplete thoughts give us an easy out to focus on those small things rather than making sure the ideas are solid. While this sort of feedback is often easier to remedy than the conceptual comments you are aiming for, it is also not a great use of anyone's time and makes it more likely that you'll have to go through more drafts to get to actually useful feedback.]. 

A "complete" draft does not have to be perfect (and you shouldn't expect anyone to think that it is... yet)! There might be parts of your argument that need refinement or maybe you're missing the perfect citation for a few key points. Your figures might not be pretty (or you might be trying a few more analyses). Your discussion might be more of a retelling and justification of what you did than a real conversation with the broader literature. That's ok!! It's also not a rough first draft. It should be a professional representation of your work and the thought you've put into it. It should make it clear to the reader that you've thought both about your work and about the fact that you are asking someone else to give their time to give you feedback. Beyond that, it's a demonstration that you can take a project from beginning to end (ideally by an agreed-upon deadline). These (professional presentation, managing deadlines, complex higher-level thinking) are the sorts of things that I can highlight in recommendation letters for jobs regardless of the sort of job you're hoping to get when you finish.

## Competent

Ok, you've got a project that is "complete", but how do you know when it's ready for the next step? I think of this as the "competent" stage. It's ready for others that are less connected to the work to get a chance to see (and review) it. In my mind, a "competent" document has a clear, cohesive, and tight argument that sets up the research question(s). The methods are expressed clearly and concisely with an eye towards reproducibility (but see [this blog post](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2025/06/03/what-your-methods-section-isnt/#toof1) by Stephen Heard). The results are final (no more analyses!!) and articulated such that their relation to the research questions are clear with figures and tables that are well-formatted, consistent, and have useful captions. Finally, the discussion summarizes the work that was done, highlights how that work fits into existing thinking about the research questions, identifies places where the results suggest a new line of questioning, and (maybe) some concrete applications to the motivating problem^[I'm a little hesitant here because this is often the place where we go horribly wrong. Either making recommendations that are implausible/impossible for practitioners to deal with or offering platitudes like "more research is necessary" as a way of avoiding any concrete statement about what we "should" do. When done well, this can be a really important part of the document, but it's hard to do well and so I'm not convinced it has to be part of a "competent" draft].  

A "competent" dissertation, manuscript, or class paper is one that is ready to be graded (if it's a class paper), defended (if it's a thesis), or submitted to a (probably moderate-impact) journal. For many folks, this is probably "done" (subject to dealing with reviews) and so it's worth thinking about how to make sure that this version of the document helps advance your career. If you are thinking about continuing on for a PhD or applying for post-docs, I think a "competent" document should (in addition to the grammatical/rhetorical advice above) demonstrate 1) your ability to develop an interesting research question grounded in existing literature; 2) your ability to select and execute appropriate methods to address that literature; 3) your ability to place the significance of your results in the context of existing knowledge. It doesn't have to be earth-shattering *per se* but it should demonstrate that you can actually *do* research and are ready to continue on to the next step in your career. In my opinion, if you are planning to go into industry (whether that's NGO's, for-profit, or government) it's probably more important to demonstrate your knowledge of the real-world contextual issues than it is to ground everything in Theory.^[That said, if you need a publication to be able to move on to the next step, you'll probably still have to demonstrate some knowledge of the existing scientific research and general thinking on your topic.] Regardless of which path you are choosing, a competent product needs to demonstrate your technical skills and your ability to communicate those skills clearly to an audience that probably hasn't thought about this as much as you and may be less convinced that they should care about what you've done. Solid arguments, compelling figures, clear writing (minimal jargon, no tortured, 5-clause sentences), and professional presentation are key! 

## Competitive

It's no secret that the academic and the environmental job market is tough right now. Trying to combine the two might be even tougher. That said, it's tough for (at least) two reasons that are worth considering in the context of trying to "finish" a project or product. One reason it's tough hasn't changed - the job is hard! If you're hoping to be an academic, you'll be asked to keep doing research, developing and delivering classes, and manage your small unit within the much larger bureaucracy of the university. If you're hoping to work in industry, you'll be asked to manage multiple projects probably focused on very different topics or geographies while (hopefully) overseeing a team that helps you move all of those projects forward. You'll be responsible for many of the same administrative tasks an academic is asked to do, but typically at a larger scale (either in terms of budget or complexity). Finding someone that can be simultaneously a creative problem-solver and an organized project manager is hard!^[so is being that person] And many organizations struggle to figure out a hiring process that actually lands that person. 

Leaving aside the more existential challenge, the practical reason it's currently hard is that a) there are more folks graduating with PhDs now than at any time in recent memory^[this is not to say that there are necessarily more great researchers! There are lots of incentives for universities to enroll and graduate students, economic shifts have led to folks that would have joined the workforce earlier staying on to complete advanced degrees, oh... and pandemics. The pool is bigger, but the skillsets and preparation seem much more uneven] and b) funds for research and environmental work are limited; there's more work to do, less to do it with, and a lack of shared vision on what those resources should be devoted to. These are not things you can fix on your own (probably, but maybe you're better than me), but you can do things to help make sure that you stand out above the noise. That you are distinct from the ever-growing cohorts of university graduates. That you are a person a university or organization sees and says "I know we don't have a ton of resources, but those resources need to go THEM". 

This is why I ask students to think a bit beyond what it means to be "done". My goal for you is to be the first (or early) step on a path towards a career fulfills you and let's you have the life you want. I make the assumption, that because you are here, some part of that career parallels the work that we do in the SPASESLab. If both of those things are true, then we should think about how to make sure that "done" describes your project, but not your journey towards that career! Given the two issues above, that means we need to think about what it means to be "competitive". 



## Wait! What about rough(er) drafts??
