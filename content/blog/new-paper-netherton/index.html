<p>We had a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837725002017?utm_campaign=STMJ_220042_AUTH_SERV_PA&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_acid=138754296&amp;SIS_ID=&amp;dgcid=STMJ_220042_AUTH_SERV_PA&amp;CMX_ID=&amp;utm_in=DM580037&amp;utm_source=AC_">cool paper</a> come out last week. Dr. Haley Netherton-Morrison, a former HES PhD student led an analysis looking at the role of space and familiarity in shaping people’s preferences for addressing sagebrush conservation issues. This was one of the first times we’ve applied Multi-level Regression with Poststratification (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/mrp.html">MRP</a>) using recruited survey data and Haley did a tremendous job trying to tease out how where we live helps shape our perspectives on how we’d like to see it managed (also she makes great figures). Check it out!!</p>
