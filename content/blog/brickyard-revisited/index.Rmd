About twenty years ago, a mentor recommended B.K. Forscher's 1963 essay [Chaos in the Brickyard](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.142.3590.339.a) as I was thinking about what it meant to be a graduate student. Since then, I've probably read it another 15 times. Sure, the language is a bit dated, but I think the general concern that scientists (especially new scientists) have become overly focused on "bricks" and not "structures" is an important one - and one that seems more relevant today than it might have 60 years ago. We actually named the student publication for the [UC Davis Graduate Group in Ecology](https://ecology.ucdavis.edu/) the [Aggie Brickyard](https://aggiebrickyard.github.io/) as a nod to the ideas and concerns that Forscher raises. I recently came across a [substack article by Kevin Munger](https://kevinmunger.substack.com/p/generalizing-knowledge-of-twitter) where he uses a similar analogy to describe the "folk theorem" of science wherein a community of scholars conduct studies that build on the work of previous scholars and respond to various questions/debates within a discipline. Knowledge, so the idea goes, grows as a function of the number and quality of studies ("bricks") accumulate. Forscher, Munger, and many others have highlighted the fact that simply accumulating bricks doesn't actually result in a house (or other structure). They highlight the fact that bricks are only useful in service of some larger, well-designed structure and that the mark of a good scientist is their ability to design elegant structures - not just produce bricks.

The idea that science (or scholarship) should lead to coherent structures that serve a purpose and that the value of any individual study is its contribution to that structure has always resonated with me.
