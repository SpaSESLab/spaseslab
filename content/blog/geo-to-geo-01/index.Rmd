> “...for all geography belongs under geology, since geography is neither more nor less than the geology of today, and [since] all geology is essentially the sum of a long succession of past geographies.” --W.M. Davis, 1911

I completed my undergraduate degree in geology at the University of Georgia, spending countless hours in the shadow of Sanford Stadium in an easily overlooked building. The Geography - Geology building, a thing of mid-century drabness wonder, contained a fallout shelter and equipment to shoot lasers at rocks in the basement and a greenspace on the roof. A large majority of the professors I remember are now emeritus, so my memory is a bit fuzzy on the layout of the building. The fallout shelter may be a figment of my imagination. However, I do distinctly remember NEVER going to the geography side of the building. To the geology students the geographers were our rivals, our mortal enemies, the “soft” GIS specialists to our “hard-rock” field mappers. And yet, here I am, many years later realizing that I am, in fact, a geographer. I am not sure when the change happened. In the time since graduating from UGA there was a gradual shift in my research from geology to geoscience, a shallowing of space, a shortening of time scales, and finally the consideration of human impacts on the land surface. These changes all combined to solidify my new (or newly acknowledged) role as a geographer.

Davis, in his annual presidential address to the Geological Society of America in 1911, had this to say about the relationship of geology to physical geography. “...for all geography belongs under geology, since geography is neither more nor less than the geology of today, and [since] all geology is essentially the sum of a long succession of past geographies.”

So both physical and human geography investigates the present at human time scales. However, “hard rock” geologists, like I was/am, mostly work with...rocks, which can be young (i.e. mid-ocean ridge basalts, 0yo) or very old (i.e. gneiss in Canada 4+Gya). Sedimentary rocks are generally younger and have shorter lives (unless of course they are metamorphosed into crystalline rocks). Relatively young means 10s of millions of years old, and evidence of our own (human) existence may not even be found in the geologic record, or if it is, it may only be a few centimeters thick (ref). Even then, said potential evidence could eventually be eroded away, subsumed through subduction, or become a unique foliation in some metamorphic rock. The point of all of this is that constantly contemplating “deep time” and our long term impact on the planet can lead to some feelings of ennui, nihilism, or recurrent existential crises. Shifting to human time scales in geography has been difficult.

But what can a geologist learn from a human geographer and vice versa? There are plenty of examples of anthropo-litho interactions. What about the human geologic record? Some researchers and scientists argue for the existence and potential starting point for the Anthropocene (meaning recent human or new human, for a new human epoch). Would records of advanced civilizations be found in the Earth's geologic record hundreds of millions of years from now? Only industrialized (using fossil fuels) would have a record?
