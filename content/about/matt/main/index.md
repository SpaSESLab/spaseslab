  I'm a conservation scientist interested in understanding how the interactions between people, their environment, and the institutions that govern them inspire (or inhibit) conservation action and how that impacts their effectiveness. His work relies on integrating theories from social psychology, public policy, and landscape ecology with diverse datasets to develop spatial models of conservation action at multiple scales to improve outcomes for biodiversity and people.
