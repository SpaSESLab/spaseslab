Scaling the knowledge obtained from localized case studies to extents and resolutions that match those typically encountered in conservation planning efforts requires identifying recurring patterns in the interactions between people; their local, regional, and national institutions; and the environment. Archetype analysis provides a methodological approach to link the conceptual depth of case studies with the extensive (but often shallow) information in public opinion surveys to characterize these recurrent patterns. Spatial representation of these archetypes can help decision-makers tailor policy and management interventions to the local context while still planning for broader landscape objectives . Archetype analyses also facilitate diagnosis of potential solutions for social-ecological challenges by explicitly linking social, institutional, and ecological factors to various incarnations of success and failure. We will develop conservation archetypes for western North America by integrating fine-resolution estimates of wildlife governance and management preferences with content analysis of the dominant narratives driving conflict and collaboration in wildlife management in western North America to explain spatial patterns in a variety of wildlife conservation actions (e.g., species reintroductions, habitat conservation, protected area passage, etc). We do this by: 1) developing fine resolution estimates of wildlife preferences, 2) using statistical learning techniques to characterize dominant conservation narratives, and 3) integrating these datasets with our growing database of environmental and institutional variables to understand how social factors contribute to or constrain successful conservation.
