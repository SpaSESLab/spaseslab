Indigenous peoples have been managing ecosystems and species since time immemorial. The practices associated with that management have shaped landscapes and the cultures of the people that inhabit them. Contemporary efforts to restore culturally important species and land management practices are increasingly seen as restorative both for ecosystems and people. Yet, such efforts often must navigate a complex suite of governance arrangements owing to the legacy of settler-colonial land tenure and legal systems. This body of research seeks to understand how participants in restoration and rewilding efforts leverage existing institutional arrangements or create new ones to achieve their objectives and how those arrangements enable or constrain the realization of the varioius benefits of restoration.
