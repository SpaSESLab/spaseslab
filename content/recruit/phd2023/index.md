## Job Summary
One fully funded PhD research assistantship is available to join the SpaSES lab at Boise State University to work on a variety of potential projects including:

* **Implications of governance preferences for species conservation:** Potential projects will draw on a survey of over 25,000 North American residents regarding their perceptions of and preferences for wildlife governance to examine how beliefs regarding the role of government in wildlife management affect conservation strategies for specific species and geographies.

* **Characterizing institutional fragmentation:** Potential projects will draw on the existing literature regarding the impacts and characterization of ecological fragmentation to examine the role of institutional fragmentation in the conservation of wildlife connectivity.

* **Wildlife conflict and public discourse.** Potential projects will integrate qualitative analysis of public documents (e.g., newspapers, environmental assessment comments, press releases) with natural language processing to characterize common themes of human-wildlife conflict and map their spatial footprint across the US and southern Canada.

### About the Program
Students will be advised by [Dr. Matt Williamson](https://www.boisestate.edu/hes/people/matt-williamson/) and join the [Human-Environment Systems community](https://www.boisestate.edu/hes/), a group of faculty, researchers, and students committed to trans-disciplinary, team-based, actionable research that addresses real-world environmental challenges.

  * Proficiency with R, Stan, Julia, or other statistical/geospatial programming languages
  * Demonstrated ability to deploy and interpret hierarchical statistical models as a tool for inference.

* Interest in combining theories and methodologies from social and environmental science disciplines.

* Stakeholder engagement is an important part of the project, so experience with, and/or a desire to gain, transdisciplinary, actionable science skills is also required. 


### Preferred Qualifications

* Demonstrated research success through peer-reviewed publications and/or other communication materials

* The desire to further develop expertise in data science and computational methods including natural language processing, topic modeling, statistical classification, and spatial modeling.
