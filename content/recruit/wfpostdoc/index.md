# Building Conservation Archetypes for western North America

## Job Summary
A Postdoctoral Researcher position is available for a project funded by the Wilburforce Foundation to characterize archetypal patterns of wildlife conservation and conflict across western North America (see project description [here](/project/archetypes/)). We seek a social-ecological systems scientist or quantitative social scientist to lead data analysis and publication primary research and support outreach to conservation partners and funders.
The position will contribute to research to identify the dominant narratives driving conflict and collaboration around wildlife management in western North America and understand how spatial variation in these narratives affect the design and effectiveness of wildlife reintroduction and conservation strategies. The successful candidate will apply a combination of web data extraction, natural language processing, topic modeling, and statistical learning classifiers (e.g., artificial neural networks, support vector machines, boosted regression trees) to corpora of public documents related to wildlife management in western North America as part of a larger effort to develop spatial models to help inform the design and deployment of conservation actions.

## Essential Functions
The successful candidate will be expected to develop reproducible workflows for preparing large corpora of text from a variety of public sources, apply natural language processing techniques to convert corpora into analyzable datasets, implement statistical classification methods, and evaluate their performance. In addition, the successful candidate will be responsible for preparing manuscripts for publication in top-tier journals, developing outreach materials, and presenting results.

The post-doc will join the [Human-Environment Systems community](https://www.boisestate.edu/hes/), a group of faculty, researchers, and students committed to trans-disciplinary, team-based, actionable research that addresses real-world environmental challenges. [Dr. Matt Williamson](https://www.boisestate.edu/hes/people/matt-williamson/) will serve as the primary supervisor. The successful candidate will join the [Spatial Analysis of Social Ecological Systems (SpaSES) Lab](https://www.spaseslab.com) and collaborate with scientists at a number of US and Canadian institutions. 

## Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities
* Because the study will be conducted at the scale of the entire western North America, qualified candidates will have strong computational training and the desire to further develop their expertise in data science and computational methods including natural language processing, topic modeling, statistical classification, and spatial modeling.

* Familiarity with environmental policy concerns and conflicts within the region is also desirable.

* Stakeholder engagement is also an important part of the project, so experience with, and/or a desire to gain, transdisciplinary, actionable science skills is also required. 

* Strong English written and verbal communication skills are required, as is the ability to work well in a team with members from a variety of disciplinary and professional backgrounds.

* Boise State University embraces and welcomes diversity in its faculty, student body, and staff. Accordingly, applicants who would add to the diversity and excellence of our academic community are encouraged to apply.

* The selected candidate must be able to meet eligibility requirements for work in the United States at the time the appointment is scheduled to begin and to continue working legally for the proposed term of the appointment.

### Preferred qualifications
We are seeking a candidate with a publication record demonstrating experience with web data harvesting, natural language processing, topic modelling, and/or quantification of spatial patterns in public sentiments.

## Salary and Benefits
The salary for this position is $51,000 + full benefits. Boise State University is committed to offering a benefits package that provides health and financial protection plans as well as resources to promote health and well-being. Our program provides flexibility so you can choose the benefits that are right for you and your family. Learn more about our benefit options at https://www.boisestate.edu/hrs/benefits/.
